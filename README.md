# Sulawesi Earthquake Dataset (1974–2024)

📍 This repository contains 50 years of earthquake records in Sulawesi, Indonesia, from 1974 to mid-2024. The dataset includes earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 and above within the following bounds:

- **Latitude**: -6.184 to 2.021  
- **Longitude**: 118.433 to 125.552  
- **Time Range**: January 1st, 1974 to July 1st, 2024  

🧠 **Usage in Research**  
This dataset was used in the study titled:  
**"Attention-based Residual Long Short-Term Memory for Earthquake Return Period Prediction in the Sulawesi Region"**,  
published in *Jurnal Ilmu Komputer dan Informasi (JIKI)*, Vol. 18(2), June 2025.

The research utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a residual LSTM enhanced with attention mechanisms, to predict earthquake return periods in the Sulawesi region based on historical seismic data.
